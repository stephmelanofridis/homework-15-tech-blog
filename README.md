Our task this week was to build a CMS style blog website. The blog was required to have a login / sign up page, a homepagw which would display existing blogs (must log in before viewing), a dashboard that displays all blogs plus options to add a blog, edit a blog, delete a blog and comment on a blog. The site was built completely from scratch and then deployed to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize, Express.js and express-session for authentication.
